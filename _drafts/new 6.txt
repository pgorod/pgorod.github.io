sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install git

wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.31/hugo_0.31_Linux-64bit.deb

sudo dpkg -i hugo_0.31_Linux-64bit.deb

Check Hugo is operational with 

hugo version

Go to some appropriate directory, and use this command to create the SuiteDocs subtree and download everything:

git clone https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteDocs.git

cd SuiteDocs

bundle install

This should pick up the local Gemfile asking for the "asciidoctor" package and install it. Check with:

asciidoctor --version

You're ready to go! To build the site you can simply type 

hugo

But you won't be using that very often because it's enough to launch the local web server, and any outstanding changes will get rebuilt:

hugo server --bind=0.0.0.0  --baseUrl=http://10.0.0.200

(change that into whatever is your local IP address. This will be the URL you put in your browser to navigate the local website).
