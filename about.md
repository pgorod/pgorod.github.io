I'm user [pgorod](https://github.com/pgorod) on Github, and user [pgr](https://suitecrm.com/forum/profile/6776-pgr) on the SuiteCRM forums.

### Me and SuiteCRM

I began tracking SugarCRM CE around 2008, and SuiteCRM ever since its inception. I worked part-time 
for SalesAgility as Community Leader between 
[2017](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/welcome-to-the-team-pedro/53341/) -
[2020](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/dear-suitecrm-community-members/72862/16).

Now I'm trying to become "an employee" of the SuiteCRM Community itself, via a 
[Sponsorship programme](https://github.com/sponsors/pgorod)
based not just on friendship and good-will, but on constantly delivering actual value.

### What else?

Apart from being a Computer Science engineer and a developer, I am also a teacher, a sysadmin, 
involved a bunch non-profit projects (mostly related to education), and I am one of those people 
with an excessive number of interests and hobbies. Stuff I like: playing indoor football, electric guitar,
ancient Greek, Kierkegaard, Cinema, Literature, politics, Media studies and Marshall McLuhan, 
Deep work, Audiophilia, etc.

### Contact me

I'm not currently providing a contact email, but you can always mention me on Github 
or post in any forum post where I participated, to get my attention.

Finally, you can send me a private message on the Forums, but please think twice before doing it.
It's better to keep all questions and support requests **public** unless it's really inadequate 
for some reason. **Discussing in public is good**, it builds up Community knowledge.

### Commenting on this site

Comments on this site are moderated, and I might remove some after a while, when doing 
clean-up of things whose interest is transitory or limited. 

I prefer that you start discussions regarding my work or my add-ons on the SuiteCRM Forums 
instead of here, because that gives me visibility while giving the Community better content.
