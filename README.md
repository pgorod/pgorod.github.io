Welcome to the **[pgorod.github.io](https://pgorod.github.io)** Github Pages!

This is a Github repository that produces a website at [pgorod.github.io](https://pgorod.github.io) where I post about SuiteCRM.

The site is made with Jekyll and you can clone it and edit it yourself, submitting pull requests. 

For this or for any other Jekyll site, here's a handy script to take care of pushing any changes you make locally:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Commit description: " desc
git add . && \
git add -u && \
git commit -m "$desc" && \
git push origin master
```

This assumes you already created a remote called `origin` for the appropriate Github project.
