The world badly needed yet another blogger, so here I am.

As I learn more about SuiteCRM, and as I get bored of repeating myself too often in the forums, I decided to put some stuff here for general reference.

I hope it will help someone. I'm sure the revenue from the ads will be very, very modest, but anyway a few cents here and there might contribute to keep me motivated to write more articles :-)

I'll try to live up to the title "In-Depth". That's what I think is most missing from the world of SuiteCRM: content that gives real insight. 

- We don't need more "there, I solved your case" forum posts, we need explanations of basic Concepts and Overviews. 
- We need stuff to help people design their data models, not just instructions on what some field in some screen does.
- We don't need any more generic sweeping fixes ("reset permissions on 30,000 files, it sometimes solves stuff"), we need real diagnoses and understanding of what's really happening.

In short: I'm an engineer and a developer, not a support person. With all due respect to support persons, they would be the first to tell you they will never do their job properly unless we do ours properly first. :-)
