title: Free Add-on for SuiteCRM - Clipboard queue
categories: [Add-ons, Tips]

My advice is that you should super-charge your Clipboard when using a CRM. Well, it's useful for much more, 
but definitely when using a CRM.

## Why use an Enhanced Clipboard?

This post is really a Tip about one of the most useful SuiteCRM add-ons I know of, which... isn't exactly
a SuiteCRM add-on, it's something you install in your Windows / Linux / MacOS.

I am not affiliated with any of the software I mention in this post.

Basically, you do a lot of copy-paste when moving around different records, browser tabs, etc. Using a
Clipboard manager let's you accumulate the things you have previously copied.

**It's like switching from the usual Alzheimer clipboard to one that remembers much more of the past.**

## Which one to use?

There are many available. I've personally used [Ditto](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) on Windows, and am now test-driving 
[CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) which runs on all major OS's and is fully-featured.

## Use-case scenarios

* **Copy-copy-copy-paste-paste-paste.** Simple, but frequently necessary. No need to go back and forth
and switch windows or tabs just to transfer those 3 fields (name, email, address, whatever). Just grab all 
of them at once, navigate once, then paste each of them into the right field from a nice graphical 
list in the UI.

* **Frequently used snippets:** Store the stuff that you always have to repeat, for quick access. Your email, 
your full name, the starts and ends of emails (`"Best regards, Me"`), and much more.

* **Backups**: I find that sometimes I even use CopyQ for small text backups. When I'm writing a long text, 
or when I'm changing something which I sense I might regret later... just copy it into the Clipboard. It will 
be there later. if I forget about it for too long, it will disappear. Perfect - that just  means I didn't 
regret my change.
