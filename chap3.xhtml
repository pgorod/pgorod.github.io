== <span class="section-number">1. </span>Introduction ==



=== What is SuiteCRM ===



The story of [https://www.suitecrm.com SuiteCRM] starts with SugarCRM. SugarCRM was founded in 2004 and consisted of an open source version (called Community Edition) and various paid for versions. However trouble started brewing when it appeared that SugarCRM would not be releasing a Community Edition of SugarCRM 7 and would be providing limited, if any, updates to the Community Edition.



Enter SuiteCRM. SalesAgility forked Community Edition to create SuiteCRM and also added various open source plugins to add improved functionality.



=== This book ===



This book is intended for developers who are familiar (or at least acquainted) with using SuiteCRM but want to perform their own customisations. SuiteCRM is a large and mature piece of software so it is impractical for a book to cover all aspects of the software. I’ve tried to add the most important parts which should allow you to make the changes you need in 99% of situations. There is a further resources chapter at the end of this book to help out in those 1% of cases. With that being said if you feel there is anything important I have left out (or worse, anything incorrect in the book) please let me know. I can be contacted at [http://www.jsmackin.co.uk JSMackin.co.uk].



=== Reading this book ===



Each chapter in this book is intended to be self contained so the reader can jump to interesting chapters. Where there is some overlap this is usually indicated with links to the relevant chapters.



Some parts of this book may refer to file paths or other parts of code that can have a variable value, for example controller names contain the module name or a file with an arbitrary name. In this case these will be marked in the form <code>&lt;TheModuleName&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TheFileName&gt;</code> or something else suitable. In these cases you can substitute something appropriate (such as <code>Accounts</code> or <code>MyNewFile</code>).



=== Setting up SuiteCRM ===



In this book we’ll be using SuiteCRM v7.1.5 which is the latest at time of writing. For up to date versions of the installation instructions see the SuiteCRM wiki at [https://suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/Installation suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/Installation].



==== Website ====



The SuiteCRM installer can be found at [https://suitecrm.com/ SuiteCRM.com]. I would recommend SuiteCRM MAX as I prefer to start with a full interface and customise it as needed.



==== GitHub ====



SuiteCRM is also available on [http://github.com GitHub] at [https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM]. Each SuiteCRM version is tagged so you can easily grab the version you need.



=== Initial Tweaks ===



After the initial install there are a few tweaks you may want to make on an instance you are developing on. These changes should improve your development flow and productivity as well as help identify issues if they occur.



==== Developer Mode ====



SuiteCRM will cache various files that it processes, such as Smarty templates. Developer mode will turn off some of the caching so that changes to files will be seen immediately (though this isn’t always the case - as is the case with [[#chap13.xhtml#extensions-chapter|extensions]]). This can be enabled either through the config file or via the General settings page inside admin.



==== Log Level ====



The default log level of SuiteCRM is <code>fatal</code>. This is a good default for production instances but you may want to increase the log level to <code>info</code> or <code>debug</code>. This will make the log output more verbose so, should anything go wrong, you’ll have something to refer to. See the [[#chap10.xhtml#logging-chapter|chapter on logging]] for more information.



==== Display errors ====



You’ll also want to turn off display errors. Unfortunately at the moment SuiteCRM has various notices and warnings out of the box. With <code>display_errors</code> on this can sometimes cause AJAX pages and the link to break.



With this being said you should be checking the PHP error logs or selectively enabling<br />

<code>display_errors</code> to ensure that the code you are creating is not creating additional notices, warnings or errors.



==== XDebug ====



[http://xdebug.org XDebug] is a PHP extension which provides profiling and debugging capabilities to PHP. This can massively improve developer productivity by simplifying development and, particularly, tracking down any issues. See the XDebug site for information on XDebug.

== <span class="section-number">3. </span>Working with Beans ==



Beans are the Model in SuiteCRM’s MVC (Model View Controller) architecture. They allow retrieving data from the database as objects and allow persisting and editing records. This section will go over the various ways of working with beans.



=== BeanFactory ===



The BeanFactory allows dynamically loading bean instances or creating new records. For example to create a new bean you can use:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.1: Creating a new Bean using the BeanFactory





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 $bean = BeanFactory::newBean('&lt;TheModule&gt;');

2 //For example a new account bean:

3 $accountBean = BeanFactory::newBean('Accounts');</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

Retrieving an existing bean can be achieved in a similar manner:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.2: Retrieving a bean with the BeanFactory





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('&lt;TheModule&gt;', $beanId);

2 //For example to retrieve an account id

3 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('Accounts', $beanId);</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

<code>getBean</code> will return an unpopulated bean object if <code>$beanId</code> is not supplied or if there’s no such record. Retrieving an unpopulated bean can be useful if you wish to use the static methods of the bean (for example see the Searching for Beans section). To deliberately retrieve an unpopulated bean you can omit the second argument of the <code>getBean</code> call. I.e.



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.3: Retrieving an unpopulated bean





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('&lt;TheModule&gt;');</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

{|

|width="50%"| [[File:images/leanpub_warning.png|50px|class=sidebar-image|warning]]

|width="50%"| <code>BeanFactory::getBean</code> caches ten results. This can cause odd behaviour if you call <code>getBean</code> again and get a cached copy. Any calls that return a cached copy will return the same instance. This means changes to one of the beans will be reflected in all the results.

|}



Using BeanFactory ensures that the bean is correctly set up and the necessary files are included etc.



=== SugarBean ===



The SugarBean is the parent bean class and all beans in SuiteCRM extend this class. It provides various ways of retrieving and interacting with records.



=== Searching for beans ===



The following examples show how to search for beans using a bean class. The examples provided assume that an account bean is available names $accountBean. This may have been retrieved using the getBean call mentioned in the BeanFactory section e.g.



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.4: Retrieving an unpopulated account bean





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>$accountBean = BeanFactory::getBean('Accounts');</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

==== get_list ====



The get_list method allows getting a list of matching beans and allows paginating the results.



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.5: get_list method signature





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 get_list(

2     $order_by = &quot;&quot;,

3     $where = &quot;&quot;,

4     $row_offset = 0,

5     $limit=-1,

6     $max=-1,

7     $show_deleted = 0)</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

; $order_by

: Controls the ordering of the returned list. <code>$order_by</code> is specified as a string that will be used in the SQL ORDER BY clause e.g. to sort by name you can simply pass <code>name</code>, to sort by date_entered descending use <code>date_entered DESC</code>. You can also sort by multiple fields. For example sorting by date_modified and id descending <code>date_modified, id DESC</code>.

; $where

: Allows filtering the results using an SQL WHERE clause. <code>$where</code> should be a string containing the SQL conditions. For example in the contacts module searching for contacts with specific first names we might use <code>contacts.first_name='Jim'</code>. Note that we specify the table, the query may end up joining onto other tables so we want to ensure that there is no ambiguity in which field we target.

; $row_offset

: The row to start from. Can be used to paginate the results.

; $limit

: The maximum number of records to be returned by the query. -1 means no limit.

; $max

: The maximum number of entries to be returned per page. -1 means the default max (usually 20).

; $show_deleted

: Whether to include deleted results.



===== Results =====



get_list will return an array. This will contain the paging information and will also contain the list of beans. This array will contain the following keys:



; list

: An array of the beans returned by the list query

; row_count

: The total number of rows in the result

; next_offset

: The offset to be used for the next page or -1 if there are no further pages.

; previous_offset

: The offset to be used for the previous page or -1 if this is the first page.

; current_offset

: The offset used for the current results.



===== Example =====



Let’s look at a concrete example. We will return the third page of all accounts with the industry <code>Media</code> using 10 as a page size and ordered by name.



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.6: Example get_list call





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre> 1 $beanList = $accountBean-&gt;get_list(

 2                                 //Order by the accounts name

 3                                 'name',

 4                                 //Only accounts with industry 'Media'

 5                                 &quot;accounts.industry = 'Media'&quot;,

 6                                 //Start with the 30th record (third page)

 7                                 30,

 8                                 //No limit - will default to max page size

 9                                 -1,

10                                 //10 items per page

11                                 10);</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

This will return:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.7: Example get_list results





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre> 1 Array

 2 (

 3     //Snipped for brevity - the list of Account SugarBeans

 4     [list] =&gt; Array()

 5     //The total number of results

 6     [row_count] =&gt; 36

 7     //This is the last page so the next offset is -1

 8     [next_offset] =&gt; -1

 9     //Previous page offset

10     [previous_offset] =&gt; 20

11     //The offset used for these results

12     [current_offset] =&gt; 30

13 )</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

==== get_full_list ====



<code>get_list</code> is useful when you need paginated results. However if you are just interested in getting a list of all matching beans you can use <code>get_full_list</code>. The <code>get_full_list</code> method signature looks like this:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.8: get_full_list method signature





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 get_full_list(

2             $order_by = &quot;&quot;,

3             $where = &quot;&quot;,

4             $check_dates=false,

5             $show_deleted = 0</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

These arguments are identical to their usage in <code>get_list</code> the only difference is the <code>$check_dates</code> argument. This is used to indicate whether the date fields should be converted to their display values (i.e. converted to the users date format).



===== Results =====



The get_full_list call simply returns an array of the matching beans



===== Example =====



Let’s rework our <code>get_list</code> example to get the full list of matching accounts:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.9: Example get_full_list call





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 $beanList = $accountBean-&gt;get_full_list(

2                                 //Order by the accounts name

3                                 'name',

4                                 //Only accounts with industry 'Media'

5                                 &quot;accounts.industry = 'Media'&quot;

6                                 );</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

==== retrieve_by_string_fields ====



Sometimes you only want to retrieve one row but may not have the id of the record. <code>retrieve_by_string_fields</code> allows retrieving a single record based on matching string fields.



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.10: retrieve_by_string_fields method signature





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 retrieve_by_string_fields(

2                           $fields_array,

3                           $encode=true,

4                           $deleted=true)</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

; $fields_array

: An array of field names to the desired value.

; $encode

: Whether or not the results should be HTML encoded.

; $deleted

: Whether or not to add the deleted filter.



{|

|width="50%"| [[File:images/leanpub_warning.png|50px|class=sidebar-image|warning]]

|width="50%"| Note here that, confusingly, the deleted flag works differently to the other methods we have looked at. It flags whether or not we should filter out deleted results. So if true is passed then the deleted results will ''not'' be included.

|}



===== Results =====



retrieve_by_string_fields returns a single bean as it’s result or null if there was no matching bean.



===== Example =====



For example to retrieve the account with name <code>Tortoise Corp</code> and account_type <code>Customer</code> we could use the following:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.11: Example retrieve_by_string_fields call





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 $beanList = $accountBean-&gt;retrieve_by_string_fields(

2                                 array(

3                                   'name' =&gt; 'Tortoise Corp',

4                                   'account_type' =&gt; 'Customer'

5                                 )

6                               );</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

=== Accessing fields ===



If you have used one of the above methods we now have a bean record. This bean represents the record that we have retrieved. We can access the fields of that record by simply accessing properties on the bean just like any other PHP object. Similarly we can use property access to set the values of beans. Some examples are as follows:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.12: Accessing fields examples





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre> 1 //Get the Name field on account bean

 2 $accountBean-&gt;name;

 3 

 4 //Get the Meeting start date

 5 $meetingBean-&gt;date_start;

 6 

 7 //Get a custom field on a case

 8 $caseBean-&gt;third_party_code_c;

 9 

10 //Set the name of a case

11 $caseBean-&gt;name = 'New Case name';

12 

13 //Set the billing address post code of an account

14 $accountBean-&gt;billing_address_postalcode = '12345';</pre>



</div>

When changes are made to a bean instance they are not immediately persisted. We can save the changes to the database with a call to the beans <code>save</code> method. Likewise a call to <code>save</code> on a brand new bean will add that record to the database:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.13: Persisting bean changes





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre> 1 //Get the Name field on account bean

 2 $accountBean-&gt;name = 'New account name';

 3 //Set the billing address post code of an account

 4 $accountBean-&gt;billing_address_postalcode = '12345';

 5 //Save both changes.

 6 $accountBean-&gt;save();

 7 

 8 //Create a new case (see the BeanFactory section)

 9 $caseBean = BeanFactory::newBean('Cases');

10 //Give it a name and save

11 $caseBean-&gt;name = 'New Case name';

12 $caseBean-&gt;save();</pre>

|width="50%"| Whether to save or update a bean is decided by checking the <code>id</code> field of the bean. If <code>id</code> is set then SuiteCRM will attempt to perform an update. If there is no <code>id</code> then one will be generated and a new record will be inserted into the database. If for some reason you have supplied an <code>id</code> but the record is new (perhaps in a custom import script) then you can set <code>new_with_id</code> to true on the bean to let SuiteCRM know that this record is new.

|}



=== Related beans ===



We have seen how to save single records but, in a CRM system, relationships between records are as important as the records themselves. For example an account may have a list of cases associated with it, a contact will have an account that it falls under etc. We can get and set relationships between beans using several methods.



==== get_linked_beans ====



The <code>get_linked_beans</code> method allows retrieving a list of related beans for a given record.



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.14: get_linked_beans method signature





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 get_linked_beans(

2                 $field_name,

3                 $bean_name,

4                 $sort_array = array(),

5                 $begin_index = 0,

6                 $end_index = -1,

7                 $deleted=0,

8                 $optional_where=&quot;&quot;);</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

; $field_name

: The link field name for this link. Note that this is not the same as the name of the relationship. If you are unsure of what this should be you can take a look into the cached vardefs of a module in <code>cache/modules/&lt;TheModule&gt;/&lt;TheModule&gt;Vardefs.php</code> for the link definition.

; $bean_name

: The name of the bean that we wish to retrieve.

; $sort_array

: This is a legacy parameter and is unused.

; $begin_index

: Skips the initial <code>$begin_index</code> results. Can be used to paginate.

; $end_index

: Return up to the <code>$end_index</code> result. Can be used to paginate.

; $deleted

: Controls whether deleted or non deleted records are shown. If true only deleted records will be returned. If false only non deleted records will be returned.

; $optional_where

: Allows filtering the results using an SQL WHERE clause. See the <code>get_list</code> method for more details.



===== Results =====



<code>get_linked_beans</code> returns an array of the linked beans.



===== Example =====



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.15: Example get_linked_beans call





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 $accountBean-&gt;get_linked_beans(

2                 'contacts',

3                 'Contacts',

4                 array(),

5                 0,

6                 10,

7                 0,

8                 &quot;contacts.primary_address_country = 'USA'&quot;);</pre>



</div>

</div>

==== relationships ====



In addition to the <code>get_linked_beans</code> call you can also load and access the relationships more directly.



===== Loading =====



Before accessing a relationship you must use the <code>load_relationship</code> call to ensure it is available. This call takes the link name of the relationship (not the name of the relationship). As mentioned previously you can find the name of the link in <code>cache/modules/&lt;TheModule&gt;/&lt;TheModule&gt;Vardefs.php</code> if you’re not sure.



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.16: Loading a relationship





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 //Load the relationship

2 $accountBean-&gt;load_relationship('contacts');

3 //Can now call methods on the relationship object:

4 $contactIds = $accountBean-&gt;contacts-&gt;get();</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

===== Methods =====



====== <code>get</code> ======



Returns the ids of the related records in this relationship e.g for the account - contacts relationship in the example above it will return the list of ids for contacts associated with the account.



====== <code>getBeans</code> ======



Similar to <code>get</code> but returns an array of beans instead of just ids.



{|

|width="50%"| [[File:images/leanpub_warning.png|50px|class=sidebar-image|warning]]

|width="50%"| <code>getBeans</code> will load the full bean for each related record. This may cause poor performance for relationships with a large number of beans.

|}



====== <code>add</code> ======



Allows relating records to the current bean. <code>add</code> takes a single id or bean or an array of ids or beans. If the bean is available this should be used since it prevents reloading the bean. For example to add a contact to the relationship in our example we can do the following:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.18: Adding a new contact to a relationship





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre> 1 //Load the relationship

 2 $accountBean-&gt;load_relationship('contacts');

 3 

 4 //Create a new demo contact

 5 $contactBean = BeanFactory::newBean();

 6 $contactBean-&gt;first_name = 'Jim';

 7 $contactBean-&gt;last_name = 'Mackin';

 8 $contactBean-&gt;save();

 9 

10 //Link the bean to $accountBean

11 $accountBean-&gt;contacts-&gt;add($contactBean);</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

====== <code>delete</code> ======



<code>delete</code> allows unrelating beans. Counter-intuitively it accepts the ids of both the bean and the related bean. For the related bean you should pass the bean if it is available e.g when unrelating an account and contact:



<div class="code-block">



Example 3.19: Removing a new contact from a relationship





-----



<div class="highlight">



<pre>1 //Load the relationship

2 $accountBean-&gt;load_relationship('contacts');

3 

4 //Unlink the contact from the account - assumes $contactBean is a Contact SugarB\

5 ean

6 $accountBean-&gt;contacts-&gt;delete($accountBean-&gt;id, $contactBean);</pre>



</div>



-----





</div>

{|

|width="50%"| [[File:images/leanpub_warning.png|50px|class=sidebar-image|warning]]

|width="50%"| Be careful with the delete method. Omitting the second argument will cause all relationships for this link to be removed.
