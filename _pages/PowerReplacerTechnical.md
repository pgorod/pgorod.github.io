## Technical Information

### Introduction

PowerReplacer is a SponsorWare add-on for SuiteCRM that provides enhanced Workflow capabilities, 
by adding buttons in views that manually trigger Workflows.

Check out the full [Product page and Demo video](/power-replacer).

### Requirements

* SuiteCRM version 7.9 or newer, using the SuiteP Theme.
* PHP version - minimum 7.2.5 (note that PHP.net is no longer supporting 7.2.x, so an even newer version is recommended)

### Ideas for Future Features

Work in progress. This add-on needs a _present_ before it can have a future :-)

### Releases
