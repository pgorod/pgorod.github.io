### Templates and variable-substitution taken to the next level

Well, actually, taken to the next _ten_ levels...

Super-charges your Email templates with dozens of additional syntax options. 
Now you can add 

* conditions, 
* localization, 
* loops, 
* date formatting options
* tables with related records, 

and generally make your Email-craft raise several levels. 

Oh, did I mention you also get advanced **Calculated fields** ðŸ˜® everywhere in SuiteCRM? 

This add-on is a bomb that multiplies SuiteCRM's usefulness, 
saves employees' time while increasing productivity and sales. 

To be released before the end June 2020.
