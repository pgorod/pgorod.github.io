### Email Templates that mold to your Customers

This SuiteCRM add-on takes email templates and variable-substitution taken to the next level! 
Well, actually, taken to the next _ten_ levels...

Email communication is crucial. Having it integrated with your CRM, able to work with customer and sales 
information from a centralized database, is a big part of the reason why you got a CRM in the first place. 

You need your CRM Emails to...

* **_Work_**: you can't have codes like `$contact_user_name` going out un-replaced to your dear customers. 
* Have **context**: any field from the record you're working on should be available.
* Have **more context**: related records typically hold crucial information, you need to be able to 
reach them easily.
* mold to your Customer's **identity**: their language, gender, time zone...
* mold to your Customer's **relationship with you**: data from their past interactions, preferences, 
purchases, invoices...

### New Syntax Options in Email Templates

Super-charges your Email Templates with dozens of additional syntax options so that this vision
can become reality.
 
Now you can use all these in your Compose Email window, or in Campaigns, or all the other places where 
Email Templates are used:

| Feature | Goal |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Conditions** | If...then...else logic that tests your data and adapts the text.  |
| **Localization** | Text labels respect the user's preferred language. |
| **Date formatting** | Specify how you want your dates shown. |
| **Date operations** | Specify dates as "1st of next month" or "Wednesday next week" and see them translated into specific days in your email. Do date calculus adding days, weeks, etc. |
| **Time zones** | Make your text sensitive to your time zone, or your customer's time zone. |
| **Related records** | Access the records related to the one you're working one. Examples: get subject of latest email form customer, total of outstanding invoices, etc.| 
| **Loops** | Iterate over a number of related records, for example, and create a comma-separated list or a table. | 
| **Maths** | Do mathematical calculations in your templates. |
| **String processing** | Various string operations: change case, concatenate, white-space control, find and replace, word wrap, regular expressions, etc. |
| **Encoding** | Control character encoding. |
| **Currencies** | Advanced currency formatting. |
| and **much** more... | |

### Calculated Fields

Oh, did I mention you also get advanced **Calculated fields** ðŸ˜® everywhere in SuiteCRM? 

If you double-click to **inline edit** a field, you can insert one of the advanced template formulas in there, 
and it will be converted before saving. Your browser will remember you entered it there once, so they 
are easy to retrieve when you use the same formula often.

This means that a thousand possibilities open up for you: quickly grab data from a related record, 
enter calculated dates, evaluate conditions, etc. 

This add-on is a bomb that multiplies SuiteCRM's usefulness, 
saves employees' time while increasing productivity and sales. 

### For End-Users or for Developers?

This all sounds very powerful, and it's not drag-and-drop. You need to write a Template text with some 
codes to handle the transformations described above. 

So yeah, this might not be every end-users cup of tea... maybe some technical help might be needed
for the more complex templates. And yes, they can get complex.

But still, this will be well within the reach of _many_ end-users, who will definitely be able 
to learn their template syntax and make their own, or make adjustments to existing ones. 
Every team out there should have at least one or two people that can do this sort of work, 
and that others can ask for help. 

In fact, what some end-users will love about this is that it frees them from the developers. They will
be able to get their work done, and adjust their CRM processes, without having to go through all the 
hierarchy and budgeting and delays of getting developers to do something for them.
