### Somewhere between automatic and manual, there lies **Productivity**...

In SuiteCRM, with Workflows you can automatically react to an event. 
You can also have Workflows go over all your records in a certain module. Meanwhile, your users 
work on manually reviewing and actioning other things in the CRM.

When these manual things are laborious and repetitive, waste your Users' time, and are prone 
to manual error, that's when you feel the need for something more.

Workflows are a great way to define a sequence of actions to apply on a record, all from 
a graphical UI. If only it was easier to trigger them right there, on the spot, when looking at
a record...

### Workflows you can trigger manually from Views!

So, [my sponsors on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/pgorod) get access to this great add-on 
which will greatly increase the power of SuiteCRM. This will convert to happier users and 
saved money in your organization, in no time.

While setting up a Workflow, you get a new option in the **Run** dropdown:

This marks the Workflow as something that will not be run when some scheduler runs, 
or when some record is changed, but rather when a user decides to run it on a record she 
has on the screen in front of her.
