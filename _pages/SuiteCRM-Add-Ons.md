### Power SuiteCRM Add-ons I created, available to my Sponsors on GitHub

#### Basic Tier

* [PowerWorkflows](/power-workflows) - adds actions buttons on views, saves your user's time by improving processes - your way.

#### Pro Tier

* [PowerReplacer](/power-replacer) - supercharges Email Templates and Campaigns. Make them dynamic and preview them 
before they go.
* [PowerFields](/power-fields) - advanced formulas (calculated fields) everywhere. Can be typed directly or set as 
defaults from Studio.
