#### Power SuiteCRM Add-ons I created, available to my Sponsors on GitHub

* [PowerWorkflows](/power-workflows) - adds actions buttons on views, saves your user's time by improving processes - your way.

* [PowerReplacer](/power-replacer) - supercharges Email Templates and Campaigns. Make them dynamic and preview them before they go.
